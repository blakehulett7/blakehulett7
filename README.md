## Hi there 👋
<p align="center">
I do my best work from the top of rollercoasters!
 
* 🐨 Certified Gopher!
 
* 🏬 Writing web servers makes me feel ALIVE
 
* ⛺ I permanently reside on the terminal
 
* 💾 I love to SQL (pronounced squeal) litely...
 
* ⚡ One day, I will write a zig simulation on par with TigerBeetle and no better
 
Currently looking for a role in backend web development, preferrably amongst fellow Gophers, but I have been known to charm a Python or two in my day.
